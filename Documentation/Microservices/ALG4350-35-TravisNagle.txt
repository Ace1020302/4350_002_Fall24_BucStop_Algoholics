Monolithic models are where all the business logic, UI, and data is stored in one central location.
These models are easy to spin up but can get confusing and complicated as additions become more complex.

Microservices break out the UI, business logic, and data into their own separate functions.
Each function serves one purpose so as to not complicate that layer of the code.
Typically broken up into three tiers: Data, Presentation, and Logic.
